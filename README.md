#Problem Statement
People often ignore daily micro-decisions such as sleep timing, study consistency, exercise, or screen usage because they seem insignificant in the short term. However, when repeated daily, these small choices compound silently and create a butterfly effect, leading to major long-term outcomes in health, focus, career, and personal growth.
Currently, there is no simple and interactive system that helps individuals:
Understand how their daily habits affect their future
Visualize the compounding impact of these decisions
Align their habits with their long-term dreams and goals

#Proposed Solution
Micro Decision Taker (MDT) is an interactive, butterfly-effect-based decision analysis system that:
Accepts daily micro-decisions (both positive and negative habits)
Calculates their long-term impact using frequency and time
Detects behavioral patterns
Evaluates alignment with the user’s dream job
Provides honest, motivating, and corrective advice using reverse psychology
Visualizes impact through graphs for better understanding
The system focuses on awareness, habit correction, and future alignment, not prediction.

    Butterfly Effect–based impact calculation (Impact × Frequency × Time)
